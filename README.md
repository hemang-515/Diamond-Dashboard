# Diamond Dashboard  
A complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization dashboard created using Python to analyze the **Diamond Dataset**.  
This project helps understand how features like **carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions** impact the price of diamonds.

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on:

- Cleaning and preparing the dataset  
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Creating visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Understanding feature relationships with price  
- Building a dashboard-like structure inside a Jupyter Notebook

##  Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **carat** | Weight of the diamond |
| **cut** | Quality of cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal) |
| **color** | Diamond color graded from D (best) to J (worst) |
| **clarity** | Purity grade (IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2) |
| **depth** | Depth percentage |
| **table** | Width of top of the diamond |
| **price** | Price in USD |
| **x** | Length (mm) |
| **y** | Width (mm) |
| **z** | Depth (mm) |

## Visualizations Included

### **🔸 1. Cut Distribution**
Shows the number of diamonds across different cut categories.

### **🔸 2. Color Grade Analysis**
Analyzes diamond color grades from D to J.

### **🔸 3. Clarity Grade Analysis**
Explores clarity levels and their distribution.

### **🔸 4. Price vs Carat Scatter Plot**
Shows how price increases with diamond weight.

### **🔸 5. Histogram Distributions**
For features such as:
- Price  
- Carat  
- Depth  
- Table  

### **🔸 6. Correlation Heatmap**
Helps identify relationships between numerical variables.
